# Machine Learning Specialization 2022

## Specialization Outline
The Specialization is divided into 3 courses:
* Part 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
* Part 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
* Part 3: Unsupervised Learning: Reccomenders, Reinforcement Learning

# Notes
## [Part 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](1.%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning/)
### Week 1
### Overview
* __Machine Learning__ is "the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed" (Arthur Samuel 1959) and is a subfield of _Artificial Intelligence_.
* There are many applications of machine learning in daily life, even without us noticing it.
  * Some include Web Search, programming Self-Driving Cars, Speech Recognition, Advertising, Healthcare, Agriculture, and much, much more.
  * Andrew described a few in his [TED talk](https://youtu.be/reUZRyXxUs4).
* AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is the intelligence of a machine that could equal or surpass human intelligence, but has been overhyped. It might take a long time, or a very long time, to achieve, but it seems the best way to get closer is through learning algorithms.
* There is a massive demand for machine learning engineers, and the demand is most likely going to increase, thus it is a great time to learn it.

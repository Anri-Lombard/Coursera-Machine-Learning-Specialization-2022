### Week 1
#### Overview
* __Machine Learning__ is "the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed" (Arthur Samuel 1959) and is a subfield of _Artificial Intelligence_.
* There are many applications of machine learning in daily life, even without us noticing it.
  * Some include Web Search, programming Self-Driving Cars, Speech Recognition, Advertising, Healthcare, Agriculture, and much, much more.
  * Andrew described a few in his [TED talk](https://youtu.be/reUZRyXxUs4).
* AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is the intelligence of a machine that could equal or surpass human intelligence, but has been overhyped. It might take a long time, or a very long time, to achieve, but it seems the best way to get closer is through learning algorithms.
* There is a massive demand for machine learning engineers, and the demand is most likely going to increase, thus it is a great time to learn it.

#### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
* __Supervised Learning__ is when you have a dataset with the correct answers, and you want to learn a function that maps from the input to the output.
  * Some examples include spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translations, online advertising, self-driving cars, and visual inspection.
  * 2 types of supervised learning:
    * __Regression__ is when the output is a continuous value (real number).
      * As an example, you could use regression to predict the price of a house.
    * __Classification__ is when the output is a discrete value (category).
      * As an example, you could use classification to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
* __Unsupervised Learning__ is when you have a dataset without the correct answers, and you want to learn a function that maps from the input to the output.
  * We ask the algorithm to determine the structure of the data, and it will try to find patterns.
  * Types of unsupervised learning:
    * __Clustering__ is when you want to group similar data points together.
      * As an example, you could use clustering to group together similar news articles.
    * __Dimensionality Reduction__ is when you want to reduce the number of features in your dataset.
      * As an example, you could use dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of pixels in an image.
    * __Anomaly Detection__ is when you want to find unusual data points.
      * As an example, you could use anomaly detection to find unusual credit card transactions.
    * __Reinforcement Learning__ is when you want to train an agent to perform a task in an environment.
      * As an example, you could use reinforcement learning to train a robot to walk.

#### Regression Model
* Linear regression model with one variable is just fitting a straight line to the data.
  * Could help predict the price of a house based on its size.
* The model (f) outputs a prediction (y-hat) given some inputs (x) after it is trained.
  * The model, f, is a mathematical formula eg. $f_{w,b}(x) = w x + b$, which is a linear model.
